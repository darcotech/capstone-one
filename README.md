# capstone-one
Final project for my DevOps PG program

We will use different tools like 
- Terraform
- aws cli
- git with GitHub
- docker
- Visual Code


While in the beginning I thought that code should be in several Terraform files, I realised that for this particular project only one file (main.tf) was just right (easy to scroll and check all code, no need to go around different files).

Some files with secret tfvars and pem files are local are not uploaded to the repository, but are the part of the files in this project.

Terraform really helps to easy deploy any number of instances and manage them.
Docker technology (containers ) are a gift any DevOps is happy to use. While you might need Kubernetes for high scalabale and high traffic web applications and websites, sometimes just the Docker is enough for smaller systems. As they say, keep it simple.
